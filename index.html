            Mercury, the innermost planet of the solar system and the eighth in
            size and mass. Its closeness to the Sun and its smallness make it
            the most elusive of the planets visible to the unaided eye. Because
            its rising or setting is always within about two hours of the Sun’s,
            it is never observable when the sky is fully dark. Mercury is
            designated by the symbol ☿.
            Mercury is the closest planet to the
            Sun, at a distance of 57.91 million kilometers / 35.98 miles or 0.4
            AU away. It takes sunlight 3.2 minutes to travel from the Sun to
            Mercury.

            Venus, the second planet from the Sun and the sixth-largest in the
            solar system, is often called the "morning star" or the "evening
            star" due to its brightness and visibility during certain times of
            the day. Its thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide traps heat, making
            it the hottest planet in the solar system with surface temperatures
            soaring up to 880 degrees Fahrenheit (471 degrees Celsius). Venus
            rotates on its axis in the opposite direction to most planets,
            causing the Sun to rise in the west and set in the east on Venus.

            Earth, our beautiful blue planet, is home to a rich tapestry of
            life, ranging from the depths of its oceans to the heights of its
            towering mountains. With a diameter of approximately 12,742
            kilometers (7,918 miles) and a circumference of about 40,075
            kilometers (24,901 miles), Earth is the largest of the terrestrial
            planets in the solar system. Its atmosphere, composed primarily of
            nitrogen and oxygen, provides the essential conditions for life as
            we know it. The planet's surface is a mosaic of continents, oceans,
            and polar ice caps, sculpted by the forces of erosion, tectonic
            activity, and weathering over billions of years. Earth's dynamic
            geology is evident in its ever-shifting tectonic plates, which give
            rise to earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and the formation of
            mountain ranges.

            Mars, often dubbed the "Red Planet" due to its distinctive reddish
            appearance, is a terrestrial world with a rich history of
            exploration and speculation. With a diameter of about 6,779
            kilometers (4,212 miles), Mars is roughly half the size of Earth,
            yet its surface area is comparable to the continents of our own
            planet. The surface of Mars is marked by a diverse array of
            geological features, including vast plains, towering volcanoes, deep
            canyons, and impact craters. Among its most prominent landmarks is
            Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in the solar system, which rises
            nearly 22 kilometers (13.6 miles) above the Martian surface.

          <p>
            Jupiter, the mighty giant of our solar system, commands attention
            with its immense size and striking appearance. With a diameter of
            approximately 139,822 kilometers (86,881 miles), Jupiter is more
            than 11 times wider than Earth and boasts a mass over 300 times
            greater than our planet's. This immense bulk is predominantly
            composed of hydrogen and helium, the same elements that make up the
            majority of the Sun. One of the most distinguishing features of
            Jupiter is its dynamic atmosphere, characterized by colorful bands
            of clouds that encircle the planet. These bands are created by
            powerful jet streams and differential rotation, causing clouds of
            varying composition and opacity to flow at different speeds and
            directions. Among these bands are iconic features such as the Great
            Red Spot, a massive storm that has raged for centuries, and numerous
            smaller vortices and eddies.

            Saturn, often referred to as the "Jewel of the Solar System," is a
            gas giant with a diameter of approximately 116,460 kilometers
            (72,366 miles) and a mass over 95 times that of Earth. Its
            composition is predominantly hydrogen and helium, similar to
            Jupiter, but Saturn's lower density gives it a unique appearance and
            structure. The most iconic feature of Saturn is undoubtedly its
            spectacular ring system, which consists of thousands of individual
            ringlets made up of icy particles ranging in size from grains of
            sand to large boulders. These rings, which extend hundreds of
            thousands of kilometers from the planet's surface, are thought to be
            the remnants of a shattered moon or debris left over from the
            formation of the planet itself.

        <div class="contentMiddle">
          <p>
            Uranus, named after the ancient Greek deity of the sky, is a gas
            giant with a diameter of approximately 50,724 kilometers (31,518
            miles) and a mass roughly 14.5 times that of Earth. Unlike the other
            planets, Uranus rotates on its side, with its axis of rotation
            tilted at an angle of about 98 degrees relative to its orbit around
            the Sun. This extreme axial tilt gives Uranus its distinct
            appearance, causing it to roll on its side as it orbits the Sun. The
            unique orientation of Uranus' axis has profound effects on its
            atmosphere and seasons. Its poles experience long periods of
            continuous sunlight or darkness, resulting in dramatic temperature
            variations and atmospheric dynamics. Uranus' atmosphere is composed
            primarily of hydrogen and helium, with traces of methane that give
            it a blue-green hue.

            Neptune, named after the Roman god of the sea, is a gas giant with a
            diameter of approximately 49,244 kilometers (30,598 miles) and a
            mass approximately 17 times that of Earth. It orbits the Sun at an
            average distance of about 4.5 billion kilometers (2.8 billion
            miles), taking nearly 165 Earth years to complete a single orbit.
            One of the most striking features of Neptune is its vivid blue
            color, which is the result of methane in its atmosphere absorbing
            red light and reflecting blue light back into space. The presence of
            methane clouds high in the atmosphere gives Neptune its
            characteristic hue, distinguishing it from the other gas giants in
            the solar system.
